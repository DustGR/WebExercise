<P>Dustin is a person.  He alls the time types HTML.  How many minutes might be found within
10 minutes?  It seems obvious that it would be ten, but can anything be understood for certain?</P>
<p>Another paragraph is certainly possible.  The existence of content is essentially irrelevant to ones
    ability to type words.  It cannot be denied that padding text is required at from time to time.
